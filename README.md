This is a basic Django web app that helps teachers keep track of the reading assignments for their students.

Teachers will be able to create a database of authors and theit books, give details on each, and in future will be able to assign books to individual student, or groups and get reviews from the students on the book assigned.

To run the project:

1. Install python3 
2. Install 'virtualenv': pip install virtualenv
3. Install 'Django':  pip install django
4. Run the server: python manage.py runserver

Access localhost:8000 at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ after running the server. 

As of now the CRUD functionalities work only at : localhost:8000/admin/

For django admin access: login is 'anija' , password is 'aniJa225**'


Modifications planned for future:
- Create student database 
- Manage reading assignments & Evaluations 
- Teacher dashboards & Reports 
- Notifications
